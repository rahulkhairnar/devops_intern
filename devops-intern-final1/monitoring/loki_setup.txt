# Loki Monitoring Setup Documentation

This file documents the steps taken to configure a local monitoring stack using Docker Compose.

## 1. How Loki and Promtail were started

The entire stack (Loki, Promtail, Grafana) is defined in 'monitoring/docker-compose.yml'.

**Start Command:**
To run the services locally using Docker:
```bash
cd devops-intern-final1/monitoring
docker-compose up -d
```

## 2. Command to view logs (Grafana Interface)

**Log Query Command Example (LogQL):**
To find all logs from our application container:
```logql
{job="devops-app"}
```

## 3. Alternative Verification Command (CLI)

If you have the Loki CLI (`logcli`) installed, you can query directly:

```bash
# Query the local Loki instance
logcli query --addr=http://localhost:3100 '{job="devops-app"}'
```
